Python Meta-circularity Story
=============================

This project surveys and catalogues tools related to meta-circularity in
relation to the Python programming language. Meta-circularity is considered
in a very wide sense, as tools written in Python dealing with processing
of the Python language itself. This ranges from meta-circular evaluators
(interpreters) to multi-level and multi-stage compilers. The focus is on
the simple, reusable tools which can be combined to implement arbitrary
complex and advanced processing.
